                  Aside from teaching dance, I like Mam's emphasis on disciple
                  and life skills. I like how she encourages all children to
                  learn. Every year, we look forward to Navarasa Navaratri and
                  Niranthara Narmada in Kalasindhu. The annual day, which began
                  this year, adds to the appeal of seeing all of the children
                  perform on one stage.<br/>
